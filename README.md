# [ai-projects](https://develis.github.io/ai-projects/)

Welcome to the ai-projects repository! This repository is a collection of projects that I have been working on while studying Generative AI. I primarily use tools like GitHub Copilot, GitHub Copilot Chat, Gemini, etc to develop solutions for personal problems.

## [Project 1: my-college-tracker](https://develis.github.io/ai-projects/my-college-tracker/)

The my-college-tracker project was created to address a personal pain point. I used to track my progress in college using a Canva page, but I wanted a more efficient way to manage my subjects and keep track of the remaining hours needed to complete my degree. This project utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, with data being stored in localStorage. Some of the functionalities are:

- Adding optional, complementary, and mandatory hours
- Adding optional subjects
- Marking the status of mandatory subjects as done, in progress, not taken yet, and considering it. This division is represented by different colors.

## [Project 2: song-recommendation](https://develis.github.io/ai-projects/song-recommendation/)

The song-recommendation project is a simple website that uses URL parameters to recommend a song. By providing specific parameters in the URL, the website generates a song recommendation based on those parameters. This project utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Some of the features include:

- Customizable song recommendations based on URL parameters
- Integration with music APIs to fetch song data
- User-friendly interface for easy song exploration

Now, to change the embedded song on the page, you need to modify the page URL to include the song URL as a parameter. For example, if the page URL is https://develis.github.io/ai-projects/song-recommendation/, you can change the embedded song on the page to the example song URL by modifying the page URL to https://develis.github.io/ai-projects/song-recommendation?songName=https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2TI5GBkbrrFtZRM5v1heeb?utm_source=generator&theme=0.
